# WeatherAPI
This repository contains backend for [czM1K3/weather](https://github.com/czM1K3/weather/). Originally was written in TypeScript with Deno (check `Deno` branch), but it was not memory and CPU efficient, so it had to be rewritten to Rust (not just because of Rust, but it was most ideal programming language at time to do this).
